I earned a BS in Chemistry from Creighton University and my PhD in Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley, where I measured and modeled stable isotopic compositions of the trace stratospheric gases CH~4~, CO~2~, and H~2~ to help constrain atmospheric greenhouse gas budgets.

I have worked as an environmental consultant for over 20 years studying air quality at spatial scales from tens of feet to the entire globe.

## Summary

Founder and Chief Scientist at the environmental consulting firm **Radical Research, LLC**. Adjunct Professor of Environmental Analysis at [Pitzer College](https://www.pitzer.edu/). Vice-chair of [Riverside Neighbors Opposing Warehouses](https://sites.google.com/view/rivnow/). I have 25 years of experience as an atmospheric scientist, 20 years of experience as an environmental consultant, and a little over a year of experience as a community activist and professor.  

My atmospheric science expertise includes near-road pollution gradients, health-risk assessments, spatio-temporal variability, source apportionment, emissions characterization, climate change, air toxics, and isotopic compositions. I typically apply statistical analysis and geospatial visualization methods to quantify and characterize air quality issues. I also develop custom applications for the display and visualization of large and complex datasets.
